Super-State Circuit-Court Jurisdictions.</u></font>
<font size="5">This document briefly describes the Geographical Boundaries &amp; Population Counts
for the Twelve Different Sovereign Federated Jurisdictions, 
into which the People of these United States of America Must Organize Them-Selves,
in Order that they may Responsibly Assume Control of Their Own Machinery of Self-Governing.

As has been shown through the discussion
in an accompanying document; in Order to effectively Secure "Truth,
Justice, Peace, &amp; Safety"; for the Common American People; these United States of America Need to be
Sub-Divided in-to the following "Hierarchal Structure":<br>
<br>

<b>Ninth Level ..................... National President &amp; Supreme Court; ................ Population Governed by ................ 281,421,906<br>
Eighth Level ............... 12 Super-State Common-Law Courts ........ (x 12); .. Population Governed by Each ........ 23,451,825<br>
Seventh Level ........... 144 Mini-State Common-Law Courts .......... (x 12); .. Population Governed by Each .......... 2,122,049<br>
Sixth Level ............. 1,728 Super-County Common-Law Courts .... (x 12); .. Population Governed by Each ............ 172,244<br>
Fifth Level ............ 20,736 Adjustable-County Courts .................... (x 12); .. Population Governed by Each ............ 14,354<br>
Fourth Level ....... 103,680 Proper Common-Law County Courts .... (x 5); .. Population Governed by Each ............... 2,870<br>
Third Level ....... 1,036,800 Precinct/Hundred Courts .................... (x 10); .. Population Governed by Each ................. 287<br>
Second Level ... 10,368,000 Town Councils, Deaconrys ................... (x 10); .. Population Governed by Each ................. 28.7<br>
First Level ..... 103,680,000 Household/Homesteads ........................ (x 10); .. Population Governed by Each .................. 2.87<br>
<br>
The "Organizing" of the above described "Ninth Level", is fairly clearly explained here.  
But when moving down to the "Eighth Level", many significant "Organizational" Questions immediately arise. 
Most of them have to do with "Geography", and "Population Counts".  
Basically; "Proportional Representation" is loosely sought to be achieved at every level of governing. 
<br><br>
As can be seen above, the Target "Population Count" for Each of the "Eighth Level" Jurisdictions is: "23,451,825".  Yet the chart below shows that many of these Twelve National Jurisdictions are significantly diverging from that ideal population count.  While the mental image invoked by accompanying Map probably delivers the best Justification for Why these Geographical Boundary Lines have been drawn in this precise manner, the below Chart sets forth the details of the basic  "Population Counts" which have been used to Justify these boundary lines.  
<br><br>
Under current Strategy for Empowering the American People to Take-Back Control of Their Government;  the concern for seeking perfectly balanced population counts has been deemed Secondary to Empowering the Sovereign American People to take Complete Control of All Levels of America's Presently Existing "Machinery of Government".  It is that very "Machinery of Government" which is presently being lawlessly mis-used to oppress our American People; and unless the very control of that "Machinery of Government" is wrested from the hands of the Organized Criminal Syndicate which now controls it, then the American People will continue to suffer under the present criminally-violent and terrorizing out-law regime. But that is another subject.
<br><br>
More perfectly balanced population counts may be achieved at later dates, 
all after the voluntary & non-coercive "Consent" of the "Qualified Electors" in each Smaller Jurisdiction is Lawfully achieved.  
It is expected that, after popularly-based control is actually achieved, that 
re-drawing these geographical lines will soon be voluntarily and unanimously accomplished, 
in order to achieve the more balanced proportional representation and population-counts in each jurisdiction, 
which is necessary for optimal central national governing.  
The geographical boundary lines and population counts set forth in this version of this document, 
should be entirely adequate for serving the organic/constitutional needs of the People of the USA, until that grand day.

All "Population Counts" have been taken from the "Year 2000 Census Bureau Statistics". <br>

<br><br>
More Reasons are set forth explaining Why the Need is Desperate for such a Constitutional Re-Organization of 
the Governmental Machinery of these United States of America, as this; is set forth in two accompanying document entitled: 
"Hierarchy Organizing for the USA" & "Orderly Governing of the USA".

While we are trying to keep these files up-dated;
those documents should be available on our folloeing web pages:
