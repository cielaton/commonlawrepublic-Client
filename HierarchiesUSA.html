_*Hierarchies USA*_*.*
(A Brief Outline of true Organic-Law & Constitutional-Law based
Governmental-Structure,

which Needs to be Adopted, in order to Secure Truth, Justice, & Peace;
for the People of these United States of America.)
As authored by Charles Stewart, V-2.0; Last Edit: 9-September-2013.

The American Constitutional concept of "Federalism" is based on the
belief that "_All Governmental Decision-Making Executive Action, Should
be 'De-Centralized' to the 'Maximum Extent Possible_' amongst the
Smaller & more Localized 'Self-Governing Communities' of the American
People". This concept of American Constitutional-Law, reaches back
through the related Common-Law Terms of 'Confederation”, & from there to
a historically obscured but bottom-up & grass-roots form of 'Feudalism'.
And all of this went even further back in time to the Ancient Biblical
"Torah/Laws" of Israel. In the 1750's or so, _William Blackstone_wrote
to affirm this, in his in famous "_Commentaries on the Laws of
England_", as follows:
*"The *_*policy of our ancient constitution*_*, as regulated and
established by the great Alfred, *_*was to bring justice home to every
man's door*_*, by constituting as *_*many courts of judicature*_*as
there are manors & townships in the kingdom; wherein *_*injuries were
redressed in an easy and expeditious manner, by the suffrage of
neighbors & friends*_*. *_*These little courts*_*, however,
*_*communicated with others of a larger jurisdiction*_*, & those with
others of still greater power; *_*ascending gradually from the lowest to
the supreme courts*_*... The course of justice flowing in large streams
... & being then subdivided into smaller channels, *_*till the whole &
every part of the kingdom were plentifully watered & refreshed*_*. An
institution that seems highly agreeable to natural reason ... *_*Moses
... 'chose able men out of Israel*_*, such as feared God, men of truth,
hating covetousness; *_*and made them heads over the people*_*,
*_*rulers of thousands*_*, *_*rulers of hundreds*_*, rulers of fifties,
and *_*rulers of tens*_*: and *_*they judged the people at all
seasons*_*; and *_*the hard causes they brought unto Moses*_*, but every
small matter they judged themselves.' *_*These inferior courts*_*, at
least the name and form of them, *_*still continue in our legal
constitution*_*: but ... these petty tribunals have fallen into decay,
and almost into oblivion ...". *

Mr Blackstone's quote here, is from _Exodus 18: 17-26_, & the "1000's,
100's, & 10's", & it is mentioned similarly in Deuteronomy 1: 13-17,
Mark & Luke. These are the numbers of Individual Households/Homesteads
which have now been shown to be the Ancient Source of our modern
American Constitutional "_Counties_, _Precincts_, _& Townships_". These
are "Lower Levels" of the "Hierarchy" in the Design of our Ancient
American Constitutional "Machinery of Government". Both Old & New
Testaments in the Bible indicate that it is the Will of the Supreme
Being that there be "_Twelve Divisions" for the "Twelve Tribes" of
Israel, at their "Top Level" of this "Hierarchal
Governmental-Structure_". And in _Revelation 7: 4, & 14: 1 & 3_where
"_144,000_" is mentioned, _clearly indicates Christian Combination of
"Multiple Hierarchal Levels" of Twelves (12's), & Tens (10's_). This
idea of _placing a "Twelves Multiple" at the "Higher Levels_" of
"Governmental Hierarchy", achieves complete Harmony with the precise
description in Revelation 21: 10-17, of Yhvh's Government of Earth,
through the "_Holy City New Jerusalem_". _As applied in its "Ideal Form"
to the People of the U.S.A_.; this "_Torah/Biblical Model" for the
"Machinery of Government_", _should look something like this_:

*Ninth Level ........ National President & Supreme Court (x 12); 
Population Governed by .................. 373,248,000 *
*Eighth Level............. 12 Super-State Common-Law Courts (x 12);
Population Governed by Each …. 31,104,000*
*Seventh Level ........ 144 Mini-State Common-Law Courts (x 12);
Population Governed by Each …... 2,592,000*
*Sixth Level ........... 1,728 Micro-State Common-Law Courts (x 12);
Population Governed by Each ....... 216,000*
*Fifth Level ........... 10,368 Adjustable Super-County Courts (x 6);
Population Governed by Each ............ 18,000*
*Fourth Level ...... 103,680 Proper Common-Law County Courts (x 10);
Population Governed by Each .... 3,000*
*Third Level ....... 1,036,800 Precinct/Hundred Courts (x 10);
Population Governed by Each ......................... 300*
*Second Level ... 10,368,000 Town-Councils/Deaconrys (x 10); Population
Governed by Each ......................... 30 *
*First Level ...... 103,680,000 Household/Homesteads (x 10); Population
Governed by Each …........................... 3 *

The present population-count for the U.S.A., as of September, 2013, is
near 317,000,000 people. Under the above calculations, readers should be
able to recognize how our entire USA can be de-centralized to
“responsibly self-govern” at every level of this hierarchy, by our
collectively embracing these simple “Nine-Levels” of
grass-roots/bottom-up & consensus-based organizational hierarchy. This
is the general Model of “Natural- Organic Government” which is here-in
being proposed for the People of our U.S.A. nation. Here-under; _our
nation would be sub-divided in-to Twelve "Responsibly Self-Governing"
"Super-States_", & the modern Constitutional Political Concept of
"_Proportional Representation_" would be followed, so far as is
comfortable in respecting the organic needs of each of these these
twelve separate governments. This all harmonizes well with our American
Constitutional ideas of how the "_Trial by Jury_" process was
originally- -intended to function to secure harmony with the “Higher
Laws” of "Natural/Organic-Law" for our American People; & all as shown
in the following quote:
*"In America ... (t)he *_*right of juries to decide questions of
law*_**_*was widely accepted*_*in the colonies, especially in criminal
cases. Prior to 1850, the judge and jury were viewed as partners ... .
The jury could decide questions of both law and fact, ... *_*Legal
theory and political philosophy emphasized the importance of the Jury in
divining natural law*_*, which was thought to be *_*a better source for
decision than the "authority of black letter maxim*_*." Since *_*natural
law was accessible to lay people*_*, it was held to be the *_*duty of
each juror to determine for himself*_*whether a particular rule of law
embodied *_*the principles of the higher natural law*_*. Indeed, *_*it
was argued*_*that *_*the United States Constitution embodied a
codification of natural rights*_**_*so*_*that "the *_*reliance by the
jury on a higher law was*_*usually viewed as *_*a constitutional
judgement*_** * *." (Civil Procedure; West Pub. Co., Friedenthal, Kane &
Miller, 1985)*

Here-under; & with a perhaps bit of spiritual/metaphysical meditation on
the matter, clear-thinking individuals should be able to comprehend that
_our entire nation can be Governed by a "Supreme Jury_". This is
certainly preferable to the more traditionally centralized forms of
Empire & Monarchy; & Moses seems clearly to have followed a model
similarly as this, as also seems to have been the preference of
Jesus/Yeshuah; & later still but more historically obscured evidence
exists that this is the source of the Camelot legend of the “Round
Table” form of Government which was presided over by King Arthur.
Here-under; a "Supreme Jury" would have the Duty to Seek Harmony through
the Collective-Conscience of their Twelve Representative-Members by
"Divining" Sociologically "Natural/Organic Law". This would all be in
pursuit of the "Collective Well-Being" of the Common American People, &
before the Face of the God of Nature; which many among us prefer to
reference as Yhvh/Jehovah. Here-under, each "Supreme Juror of the USA"
would be Elected as a Confederated Sovereign Representative from his
approximately 1/12th of our national Population. Further; all national
governmental-policy would follow Constitutional "Due Process of Law",
aka: the "Rules of the Common-Law"; & all of this would be just as the
"_Seventh Amendment_" to our “_US-Constitution_” document indicates, as:
*"In Suits at common law, where the value in controversy shall exceed
twenty dollars, the right of trial by jury shall be preserved, and *_*no
fact tried to jury*_*, *_*shall be otherwise reexamined in any Court of
the United States*_*, *_*than according to the rules of the common law*_*."*

Here-under; our much more natural/organic
_President/Chief-Executive/Monarch__would be subject to "Immediate
Recall_" from each of the 12 lower-level "Supreme Court Judges", as each
are separate representatives of the best interests of each of their 12
separate & independent sovereign super-states. _Any among these supreme
twelve__would have full lawful authority to call for a “Vote of
Confidence” in the acting President_at any moment that he deems that by
doing so, that he would not be risking his credibility & honor as a
responsible member of this inner-council of our national organic
body-politic. And as similarly under our nation's original “Articles of
Confederation”, a “General- Congress” would ideally be formed, &
numbering 144, all as the “Seventh Level” of hierarchy above would
indicate. Here-under; deeper levels of support for a “Confederated
Representation” would be achieved; & the afore-said “Immediate Recall”
process could be very promptly invoked, as against any of the 12-members
of the supreme inner-council & court, as from any one of the 144
representatives in the seventh-level of this hierarchy might similarly
choose to exercise their own “Vote of Confidence”, as against their own
consensus-based representative at the more centralized eighth level.
Prior to the adoption of our nations “Seventeenth Amendment”, this same
lower-level hierarchal accountability process empowered our individual
state legislative-assemblies to exercise this same basic “Immediate
Recall” process over their representatives in our United States Senate.

Here-under; each of a profoundly simplified twelve supreme judges gains
their legitimacy to “speak-law” in our nation's supreme higher-
jurisdictional council. This same basic intelligently-designed
governmental power de-centralizing “Immediate Recall” & “Vote of
Confidence” invoking mechanism is applicable “At Every Level” in this
entire Governmental-Hierarchy.
Once a Consensus was formed around which among them was the”Most
Qualified Leader” of their supreme court of law & inner-council; that
individual would act as "Presiding Officer" & "Facilitator" in their
Deliberations, similar to a "Jury Foreman"; &, as unanimously agreed to
be in their collective best interests, he would Direct all civilian &
military "Force" in-to such "Harmonious Battle Strategy" as any
Consensus among the eighth-level inner-council adjudicated to be
justified & necessary. Through applying these powerful Seventh-Amendment
Common-Law Principles, the "Constitutionally Lawful Authority" is
present to Force the Displacement of Any & All of our nation's
office-holders. Here-under; the Separate Duties of the 12 "Federal
Reserve Banks" may each be taken-over; & the IRS, FBI, FEMA,
“Homeland-Security”, & every federal governmental office may have its
power effectively de-centralized; yet all of this in such manners as
would not cause any trauma or endangerment to the welfare to our
nation's general-population. Here-under' "National Economic Policy"
would be co-ordinated by "Unanimous Verdict" in the "National Supreme
Court"; & America's Military could be Called Home, & Sub-Divided up to
return to their homes & families in their Twelve Sovereign
Jurisdictions. All Affairs of All Local Governments in the entire
Hierarchy would be handled by Those there-in, unless they Invited
Outside Help in-to Their Jurisdiction.
There is much more to all of this shown on our web page below. America's
States & Larger Counties, Cities, & Metro-Districts, should each Elect
their Own Leaders & adopt similar "Deep Hierarchy Structure" as the
above graph would indicate to apply to them. These Jurisdictions need to
contemplate Re-Structuring their Geographical Boundaries, so that the
Resultant "Population Counts" will "Comfortably Fit" into the above
National Governmental Model. And our Nations "Supreme Jury" needs to
Consider Unanimously Approving our Merging into a Similar Government for
the Entire Planet. This can be Achieved by placing a "10th Level" at the
Top of the Hierarchy, & by converting the Adjustable "5th Level", from 5
Divisions to around 8. The Forces which oppress our American people,
similarly oppress honorable people every-where; & we all need to be
"Working Together" to confront them through this sort of an organic,
consensus-based, & confederated Governmental Model.
